LabCraft

These are completely tentative ideas, in no way promised features, and will serve as a rough outline at best.

Early game
----------

Tools
	Bunsen Burner - Used for heating fluids/gases - can use (char)coal slowly for heat source
	Pipette - Pick up very small amount of chemical, used for moving chemicals from bottles (storage) to flasks (crafting/mixing)
	Mortar and Pestle - Crush materials into powder
	Tongs - Move dangerous flasks safely
	Safety Goggles - Needed to avoid negative potion effects when working with some chemicals
	Lab Counter - I dunno, looks cool?

Glassware (http://www.compoundchem.com/2015/03/17/glassware/)
	Reagent Bottle - Primary chemical storage, placeable in world.  Colored by chemical inside.  http://www.novatech-usa.com/core/media/media.nl?id=32136&h=cc8d64efc4cee629e8f9
	Vials - Portable solution, used for potions or in-world interactions (eg. burning through dirt/stone)
	Flasks - Used for crafting
		Erlenmeyer Flask - Used for swirling liquids by hand (mixing)
		Volumetric Flask - Used for precise dilution and preparation - pear shaped, long top
		Boiling/Round Bottom Flask - Used for boiling liquids - large rounded bottom, short top

The early-game allows the creation of vials (potions).  Primary ingredients are stored in placable reagent bottles
(akin to Thaumcraft "jars"), and using pipettes allows the mixing of chemicals in different flasks.  The end results
are stored in vials for use.

Mid game
--------

Machines
	Centrifuge - Separate substances.  Primary purpose is content-gating.  Its use opens mod to new chemical types and better vials
	Fume Hood - Protect against toxic gases
	Microwave - Heat substances - heats substances, uses low RF power

The centrifuge and fume hood enable the creation of more advanced chemicals, which can create better vials.
Their primary purpose is to content-gate mid and late game content, and should be considerably more expensive
to build.  The microwave is a direct upgrade to the bunsen burner, and allows further automation.

Late Game
---------

Tools
	Full protective suit - needed to avoid airborne viruses
	Tweezers - Used to pluck DNA from mobs/plants/players

Machines
	Sequencer - Used to scan DNA into a usable state
	Splicer - Used to mix DNA to engineer virus
	Imbuer - Imbue final DNA onto live virus

Each machine must be built in a special safe room, with various chemicals being needed to construct the virus.
The end result can have varying effects, from killing players (designated by initial DNA) to protecting them.
